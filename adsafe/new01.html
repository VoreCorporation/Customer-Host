<h3>Prototype Advantages and Rapid Prototyping Benefits</h3><br/>

<p>Rapid prototyping is a process of software development wherein physical objects are automatically constructed by means of SFF or solid freeform fabrication. In the process of rapid prototyping, a prototype or working model can be constructed quickly, and tested for its functionality, performance and output. The new features or ideas can be illustrated well in the prototype and early user feedback can be gathered with regards to the product. There are numerous advantages of rapid prototyping.</p>

<p>Benefits of Rapid Prototyping: Significant advantages of rapid prototyping include reduction of project cost and risk. Generally, one or more prototypes are developed in the process of software development in a series of incremental and iterative steps. Every prototype that is manufactured is based on the previous designs' performance and it is a corrective process through which the past design defects or problems are corrected. The product is readied for production when the prototype is refined as per requirements and meets all the design goals like manufacturability, robustness and functionality.</p>
